# Relationship between Weather and Goals in the German Bundesliga

This repository holds the code for downloading, processing, preparing, and plotting the data for a simple investigation of the relationship between weather conditions, specifically temperature, and total number of goals scored in the German Bundesliga (currently looking at the seasons 2016/17 - 2020/21).

All the data should be put into folder named "Data" in the main directory holding the code files.
